            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
                    <li>3 teaspoons ginger, grated</li>
                    <li>4 teaspoons garlic, minced</li>

                    <li>2 tablespoons mirin or rice wine vinegar</li>
                    <li>4 cups vegetable stock (or chicken stock)</li>
                    <li>½ cup fresh shiitake mushrooms</li>
                    <li>2 eggs</li>
                    <li>1 cup baby spinach</li>
                    <li>2 (3 oz) packs dried ramen noodles</li>
                    <li>hot sauce, to taste (optional)</li>
                    <li>½ cup green onions/scallions, sliced</li>
                    <li>1 cup carrots, shredded</li>
                    <li>sesame seeds (optional, for topping)</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat the sesame oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the garlic and ginger and cook for a couple minutes until soft and fragrant. Stir in the soy sauce and mirin and cook for another minute. Add the stock and bring to a simmer. Simmer for 5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Add the mushrooms and simmer for another 10 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, bring a small pot of water to a boil. Add the eggs and cook for exactly 7 minutes for a slightly runny yoke or 8 minutes for a soft yolk. Remove eggs from the pot and place in a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking process. After a few minutes, peel the shells off carefully and slice the eggs in half, lengthwise. Set aside.</li>
                    <li>Bring another pot of water to a boil. Add the spinach and cook for about a minute, until just wilted. Remove from pot and run under cold water to stop the cooking process. Drain and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Add ramen noodles to stock mixture and cook 2-3 minutes or according to package instructions. Add some hot sauce, to taste (optional).</li>
                    <li>Divide the soup into 2 large bowls.</li>
                    <li>Top with an egg, spinach, carrots and green onions. Sprinkle with sesame seeds (optional) and serve immediately.</li>
                </ol>
